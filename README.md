A calculator for various stats related to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate's Spirit Board and World of Light modes. Compete with your friends, or collaborate with them! This was used for stat tracking during my [World of Light Let's Play](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLicMRanzGjcoNyhCiakeTut99iYHAIuTc).
A usage guide can be [found in the repo wiki](https://github.com/MathWiz86/Ultimate-Spirit-Stat-Calculator/wiki).
